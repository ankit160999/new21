                    “We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it
                    because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally
                    comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our
                    desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was
                    intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were
                    absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn
                    round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.”

                    “You're on the verge of your breakthrough. Your next level is near and your dreams are about to take
                    flight. Believe it. You need to fight off the fear and prepare for the weight of favor, abundance
                    and responsibility coming your way. ”
